# A Minimized Config for Myself

Many configurations, such as [amix/vimrc](https://github.com/amix/vimrc), are incredibly useful and amazing. However, they tend to be quite large and contain numerous functions that I don't require. Sometimes, I find their complex operations a bit confusing.

In this repository, I aim to create a minimal configuration that suits my needs perfectly.

## Usage

```bash
git clone git@github.com:yuikns/vimrc.git ~/.vim_runtime
cd ~/.vim_runtime
./setup.sh
```
